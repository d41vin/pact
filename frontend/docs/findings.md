for implementation prompt worked with claude.ai:
-quickly asnwer questions by claude.ai with augment code and amp and chatgpt
-verify generated implementation prompt with ai coding ext and chatgpt (chatgpt is really good at this.)

//

claude.ai implementation mode:

-specifically ask to now rewrite schema fully cause its a large file and would take up credits, ask for it to let me know which parts needs editing and which parts are to added rather than generating entire schema file, cause its a large file and would take up credits.

Do not use up github context, try not to go over 50%.

while claude.ai is working on a implementation prompt and requires wait, then move on to next feat dev, dont waste time.
